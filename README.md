# ElectionDataAnalysis

This study aims to explore the socio-economic and educational factors influencing voting patterns across different U.S. counties. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which compiles data from the 2020 Presidential Election, Harvard Dataverse, and the USDA Economic Research Service, we focus on variables such as unemployment rate, median income, urban influence codes, and education levels. These variables provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the interplay between socio-economic conditions and political preferences in diverse county-level populations.
